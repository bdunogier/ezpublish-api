/**
 * This code example illustrates the issue with very generic exceptions.
 *
 * It tests the following scenario:
 * - create an article
 * - set the title to a string that is too long for the max length constraint set for the 'title' field
 * - catch and interpret the validation exception
 *
 * This is done in 3 ways:
 * 1. The current way, with a global exception upon contentCreate()
 * 2. Using exceptions thrown when setting the value on the struct
 * 3. Using a more specialized  exception thrown when contentCreate() is called
